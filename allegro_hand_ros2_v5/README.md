# Allegro Hand V5 ROS2

This is the official release to control Allegro Hand V5 with ROS2(**Only V5 supported, V4 is not supported**). Mostly, it is based on the release of Allegro Hand V5 ROS1 package.
You can find our latest Allegro Hand V5 ROS1 package :(https://github.com/Wonikrobotics-git/allegro_hand_ros_v5)
And the interfaces and controllers have been improved and rewritten by Soohoon Yang(Hibo) from Wonik Robotics.

We have integrated the core elements of two ROS packages(allegro_hand_description, allegro_hand_parameters) into a main package(allegro_hand_controllers).

**For now, we support three additional action.**
- Visualize Allegro Hand V5 changing in real time using Rviz2.
- Save customize pose using MOVEIT2 and move to the saved pose.
- Simply control hand with GUI tool instead of using keyboard.

These packages are tested on ROS2 Humble(Ubuntu 22.04). It will likely not work with newer or older versions(Rolling, Foxy ...).
